This game was created in Godot
The .exe can be downloaded from my account on itch.io

What I learned: As my first time creating a game, the entire structure and methodology behind creating a game from creating a ploay, storyboards, half-way check ins with tutor, up to exporting the game as a whole was learned. 

What I liked: I really like the world and storyline that is followed throughout. 

What I would change if I did it again:
